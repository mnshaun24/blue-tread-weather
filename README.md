**PURPOSE**
Part of BlueTread technical assessment. Assignment to build a weather app that displays 14 day forecast. 

**NOTES**
App uses a web API to return weather data and uses that for the forecast. I was a little fuzzy on whether "must have a backend API" meant a web API would suffice or if I should build out an express server for the request. As I did not see requirements about connecting a front-end to a back-end, I kept the overhead light and did not build a server.
